# Windows System Programming 4th edition

## Introduction

This is an unofficial source code repo for Johnson M. Hart's book [Windows System Programming 4th edition](https://www.ebooks.com/en-au/book/726522/windows-system-programming/hart-johnson-m/). No representation is made that the source code belongs to me, it's simply reproduced here for convenience (so you don't need to dig up the physical media of the book) and remains the copyright of Johnson M. Hart.

## Changes

Currently, the source code in `src` is committed as is from the [book's website](http://jmhartsoftware.com/) (this includes libs and exe files). While there are Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 (x64) solutions provided, I'm in the process of adding a new VS2022 solution and projects to replace these.
