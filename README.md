# Windows System Programming 4th edition

## Introduction

This is an unofficial source code repo for Johnson M. Hart's book [Windows System Programming 4th edition](https://www.ebooks.com/en-au/book/726522/windows-system-programming/hart-johnson-m/). The source code is reproduced here for convenience and remains the copyright of the book authors.

## Changes

Currently, the source code in `src` is committed as is from the [book's website](http://jmhartsoftware.com/) (this includes libs and exe files). While there are Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 (x64) solutions provided, I'm in the process of adding a new VS2022 solution and projects to replace these.
