/*  Usage: TestLock FileName mode
Mode: 1 - Get a share lock and hold it until prompted to release it 
      2 - Get an exclusive lock and hold it until prompted to release
      3 - Attempt to read the file, then retry when prompted
	  4 - Attempt to write to the file; retry when prompted  */

/*	This very simple program was developed to illustrate the
	file locking logic in Tables 7-1 and 7-2.
	You should have two console prompts and execute TestLock.exe
	in each using different "mode" values. First, create a small
	file to use in the test; assume its name is "lock.txt"
	For example, in conosle 1 execute:
		TestLock lock.txt 1
	to create a share lock. In the console 2 try in succession:
		TestLock lock.txt 2     You can not create an exclusive lock over a share lock
		TestLock lock.txt 1     You can create a second share lock
		TestLock lock.txt 4     You can not write over a share lock
		TestLock lock.txt 3     You can read over a share lock even without a lock.
