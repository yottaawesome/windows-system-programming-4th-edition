/* Chapter 3. tail command. */
/* tail file - Print the last 10 lines of the named file.
	All options are ignored. The file must be specified. */

/* This program illustrates:
	1. Getting the file size.
	2. Setting the file pointer.
	3. LARGE_INTEGER arithmetic and using the 64-bit file positions.
	4. Getting the current file position by moving
		0 bytes from the current position. */

/*  UPDATES. APRIL 12, 2010. 
 *  1. The program uses GetFileSizeEx and SetFilePointerEx, which are much easier to use than the non-Ex versions and
       are supported in all the target Windows systems.
 *  2. There are some corrections, suggested by Kwan Ting Chan (KTC) to account for the line size and UNICODE usage.
 *
 *  LIMITATIONS: Lines shouldn't be longer than 256 characters
 *  It's assumed that the text file is UNICODE or not depending on how the program is built. There is no attempt to
 *  deteect the file type (we leave that as an exercise for the reader).
