/*	Comments about terminating the connection thread:
	There is an issue with the fact that the Connect thread
	could still be running. You would like to terminate it, but then 
	there would not be a clean thread shut down, and, for example, 
	DLL entry points would not be called, resulting in potential resource leaks.
	Now, in this case, the connection thread is minimal, so there should be
	no harm, but, here we've used a different approach:

	The connection thread can be resumed by having the server
	act like a client and perform a CreateFile to get a (very) short lived 
	connection, allowing the connection thread to shut down.

    Unfortunately, there is a problem here; any Connect thread could respond,
	not the one on the server instance we're interested in. We've ignored that
	here as there's only on connect thread.

	Nonetheless, here are a couple of other solutions that are tempting
	to try, but they both have problems.
	
	IDEA 1. Close the named pipe handle. Perhaps, that will cause the ConnectNamedPipe
	call to fail and the Connect thread can terminate. Unfortunately, CloseHandle 
	blocks while there is an active ConnectNamedPipe call.
		CloseHandle (hNamedPipe);  // Don't do this! It could block.
	
	IDEA 2. Terminate the thread. The problem is that DLL entry points will
	not be called, resulting in potential resource leaks mentioned above.

	NOTE: DLL entry points were discussed in Chapter 5 but have not been illustrated
	yet. There is an example in Chapter 12.

	IDEA 3. Use thread cancellation using asynch proc calls (Chapter 10).
	Unfortunately, the client may not be in an alertable wait state.
