/* This program illustrates:
	1. Named pipes from the client side. 
	2. Long-lived connections with a single request but multiple responses.
	3. Reading responses in server messages until and end of response is received.
*/

/* Special commands recognized by the server are:
	1. $Statistics: Give performance statistics.
	2. $ShutDownThread: Terminate a server thread.
	3. $Quit. Exit from the client. */
