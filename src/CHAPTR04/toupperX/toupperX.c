/* Chapter 4, toupper command.   */

/* 
	Convert one or more files, changing all letters to upper case
	The output file will be the same name as the input file, except
	a "UC_" prefix will be attached to the file name.

/* This program illustrates:
	1.	Exception handling to recover from a run-time exceptions
		and errors by using RaiseException).
	2.	Completion hanlders.
	3.	Program logic simplification using handlers. */

/* Technique:
	1.	Loop to process one file at a time.
	2.	Read the entire file into memory, allocating the memory and
		output file first. DO NOT WRITE OVER AN EXISTING FILE
	3. 	Convert the data in memory.
	4. 	Write the converted data to the output file.
	5.  Free memory and close file handles on each loop iteration. */
